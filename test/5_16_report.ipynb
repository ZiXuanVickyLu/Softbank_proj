    "## Cow parameter model with retargeting\n",
    "We use SMAL (Skinned Multi-Animal Linear model) as the raw parameter models.\n",
    "![](../data/smal.png)\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Input: SMAL parameters\n",
    "Output: High resolution cow model\n",
    "\n",
    "pipeline: SMAL parameter -> registed smal raw model -> chamfer distance using point cloud register -> caculate the intepolation matrix -> retargeting -> skinning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "The SMAL model is a function $M(\\beta, \\theta, \\gamma)$ of shape $\\beta$, pose $\\theta$ and translation $\\gamma$. \n",
    " - $\\beta$ is the PCA shape space\n",
    " - $\\theta\\in \\mathbb R^{3N}$, where $N=33$ is the relative rotation of 33 joints in the kinematic tree\n",
    " - $\\gamma$ is the global translation applied to the root joint \n",
    " - Input: $\\beta,\\theta,\\gamma$\n",
    " - Output: $M(\\beta,\\theta,\\gamma)$ is a 3D model.\n",
    "- To be specific: $M(\\beta,\\theta,\\gamma)=\\text{LBS}\\left(\\Theta(\\theta,\\gamma),\\overline{T}(\\beta)\\right)$\n",
    "  - LBS is linear blend shape model, taking the template and pose\n",
    "  - $\\overline{T}(\\beta)$ is the template of registered pose taking the shape vector $\\beta$\n",
    "  - $\\Theta$ is the per-joint transform taking the relative pose vector $\\theta$ from kinematic tree and a global tranformation $\\gamma$ to the root joint.\n",

    "### Retargeting\n",
    "#### Point cloud registering\n",
    "Problem Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two point clouds:\n",
    " - Source point cloud $S = \\{s_1, ..., s_n\\}$\n",
    " - Target point cloud $T = \\{t_1, ..., t_m\\}$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The goal is to find the optimal rigid transformation (rotation $R$ and translation $t$) that aligns the source point cloud with the target point cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformation Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The rigid transformation is defined as:\n",
    "$s'_i = Rs_i + t$ where $R$ is a 3×3 rotation matrix,\n",
    "$t$ is a 3×1 translation vector,\n",
    "$s_i$ is a point in the source cloud,\n",
    "$s'_i$ is the transformed point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We uses the SO(3) exponential map to parameterize rotation:\n",
    "$R = \\exp(\\omega^\\wedge)$ where:\n",
    "$\\omega$ is a 3D rotation vector,\n",
    "$\\exp$ is the matrix exponential,\n",
    "$^\\wedge$ converts a 3D vector to a 3×3 skew-symmetric matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chamfer Distance as loss function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses Chamfer Distance as the loss function:\n",
    "$$L(S, T) = \\frac{1}{|S|}\\sum_{s \\in S}\\min_{t \\in T}||s - t||^2 + \\frac{1}{|T|}\\sum_{t \\in T}\\min_{s \\in S}||s - t||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We aimed to use point registering algorithm to achieve the retargeting.\n",
    " - Motivation: input ($\\beta$,$\\Theta$), output: fine mesh\n",
    " - The backward gradient to reduce the loss:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial{\\text{chamfer\\_distance}}}{\\partial \\{\\beta,\\Theta\\}}=\\frac{\\partial \\text{chamfer\\_distance}}{\\partial \\text{fine\\_mesh}}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial \\text{fine\\_mesh}}{\\partial \\text{SMAL\\_model}}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial \\text{SMAL\\_model}}{\\partial \\{\\beta,\\Theta\\}}$$\n",
    " - The fitting step will output the $\\{\\beta,\\Theta\\}$, we can then use the gradient from SMAL and the interpolation matrix between SMAL raw mesh and the fine mesh($\\frac{\\partial \\text{fine\\_mesh}}{\\partial \\text{SMAL\\_model}}$) from the same pose as well as the gradient from point cloud registering ($\\frac{\\partial \\text{chamfer\\_distance}}{\\partial \\text{fine\\_mesh}}$) to obtain the retargeted fine mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post process on skinning mesh**\n",
    "We use a Laplacian energy as regular term to optimize the distortion after skinning.\n",
